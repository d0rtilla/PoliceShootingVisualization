### Overview

It is no secret that a substantial number of deaths in the United States result from police actions. We chose to do our project using a dataset that compiled reports of people who were shot and killed by police officers in the United States. 

### The Dataset

We obtained the dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ramjasmaurya/us-police-shootings-from-20152022. This set was created by Ram Jas (www.kaggle.com/ramjasmaurya). It contains data on people who were shot and killed by the police within the United States from January 1st, 2015 through September 7th, 2022. 

### The Process

We extracted and cleaned the data using Pandas in a Jupyter Notebook.

We loaded the data into MongoDB. 

We created a website using Flask and HTML files. We used Flask to interact with the MongoDB using Pymongo.

We formatted and styled the website with Bootstrap.

We created different visualizations to explore the data. We used D3 to insert the visualizations and other content into the web pages. We used Plotly, Leaflet, and Chart.js to create the various visualizations of the data.

We included a discussion page as part of the website to try to draw conclusions based on the visualizations we made.
