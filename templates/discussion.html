            <p>With the help of the visualizations we created, many important trends were exposed.</p>
            <p>It was revealed that males constitute more than 94% (4,745) of the victims while only only 255 or 5.1%  of them were females. We also discoverered that although black people make up only 12% of the US population, they represent a staggering 26.7% (1,355) of the victims in our dataset. The data also shows that people ages 25 to 34 are the ones most likely to be shot by Police as they constitute 33.84% of the 5,000 victims, and people aged 18 and younger are least likely to fall victim as they make up only 1.96% of the total number of vitims.  Our barchart shows the type of items held by the victims when they were shot by police. 2,986 of the victims were carrying a gun, 767 a knife, 378 were unarmed, 196 carried a toy weapon, 569 of them carried  unique items, and 173 of the vicims were involved in vehicle related activities. This is a clear indication that wielding a gun during a police encounter increases the possibility of being shot.  As the dataset contains the longitudes and latitudes of the locations where the the victims were shot, we were able to create an interactive  map that shows the areas they were shot. We  discovered that many of the shootings occurred mostly in  urban communities.</p>

            <p> We are very grateful to Ram Jas who shared this dataset and enabled us to put our skills to use and create these visualizations. The findings here wouldn't be possible without their help. Please leave any comments and suggestions below.</p>
